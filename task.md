### Task:
Our team would like to integrate game day weather data into our internal applications.  Your task is to compile a dataset of historical weather forecasts for NFL games using a modern programming language (Python, Typescript, C#, etc.).  You should use the Open Meteo weather API (https://open-meteo.com/) to gather a dataset of historical weather forecasts for all regular season games from the 2021 – 2023 NFL seasons.  The attached CSV files include information about NFL venues and the NFL schedule from the 2021 – 2023 seasons.
 
Finally, use SQL to perform five or more queries on the dataset that you think might yield interesting results. 
 
You should use your discretion, creativity, and intuition when determining which weather variables (Temperature, Humidity, Precipitation, etc.) from the Open Meteo API are valuable to include in the final submission.
 
### Requirements:
Use a modern programming language (Python, Typescript, C#, etc) to fetch weather data from the Open Meteo weather API.
Combine this data with the attached Venue and Games CSV files to produce a comprehensive dataset of historical weather for NFL games.
Use SQL to perform at least 5 interesting queries on the dataset.
Engineer a reusable method to easily retrieve weather forecasts for upcoming games in the 2024 season.  Assume the upcoming schedule is unknown and this method will be run on a continuous basis in the days leading up to the scheduled games.
Ensure your code is well-structured, documented, and follows best practices.
### Submission:
Upload your final dataset and the accompanying code and SQL scripts to a public GitHub and send back a link to the repository.
Include a README file with instructions in how to run your application to retrieve data from the Open Meteo API and any relevant details.
Include a brief explanation of your assumptions, approach, and any interesting insights you gained from your analysis.
